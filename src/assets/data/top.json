The industry's electricity consumption is projected to surge dramatically, with TSMC alone consuming more than 8% of Taiwan's total electricity in 2023. This demand is expected to triple by 2030, driven by the production of advanced chips and energy-intensive processes like extreme ultraviolet lithography",

Over 90% of its energy needs are met through imports, primarily coal and natural gas. This dependency is particularly concerning given the geopolitical tensions with China, as a potential blockade could severely impact Taiwan's energy security. The island's natural gas reserves, crucial for about 40% of its electricity generation, are especially precarious with only an 11-day supply on hand, planned to increase to 14 days by 2027. In contrast, coal reserves are more substantial at 42 days, providing a slightly longer buffer in case of supply interruptions",

The operating margin on the grid, which should ideally be 25% in a secure system, has dropped to as low as 5% on several occasions in recent years. These incidents underscore the fragility of Taiwan's power system and its struggle to maintain a stable electricity supply.

Addressing the energy crunch requires a multifaceted approach, including enhancing generation capacity through decentralized renewable sources, expanding energy storage facilities, and potentially reconsidering the complete nuclear phase-out. Additionally, land constraints and political considerations complicate efforts to expand renewable energy capacity, while underpriced electricity bills have led to increased demand and supply shortfalls",
