  "introduction": "Taiwan's energy sector faces a critical juncture as the island grapples with an intensifying power crunch, threatening its economic backbone—the semiconductor industry. As reported by CNBC, Taiwan has endured three major outages in the last seven years, highlighting the precarious state of its energy infrastructure and raising concerns about the sustainability of its crucial chip manufacturing capabilities.",

        "description":"Taiwan's semiconductor industry, particularly TSMC, is facing significant challenges due to its rapidly increasing energy demands. The industry's electricity consumption is projected to surge dramatically, with TSMC alone consuming more than 8% of Taiwan's total electricity in 2023. This demand is expected to triple by 2030, driven by the production of advanced chips and energy-intensive processes like extreme ultraviolet lithography",
        "points":[
            "TSMC's annual energy usage has grown 10-20% in recent years, reaching over 24 billion kilowatt-hours in 2023",
            "The semiconductor industry's electricity consumption is estimated to double by 2030, reaching 237 terawatt hours globally",
            "Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing electricity use is projected to increase 236% between 2021 and 2030",
            "The rise of AI and demand for more powerful chips is further accelerating energy needs, with TSMC's 3nm chip production significantly contributing to increased consumption"

        "heading":"Reliance on Imported Fuels",
        "description":"Taiwan's heavy reliance on imported energy sources leaves the island vulnerable to supply disruptions and price fluctuations. Over 90% of its energy needs are met through imports, primarily coal and natural gas. This dependency is particularly concerning given the geopolitical tensions with China, as a potential blockade could severely impact Taiwan's energy security. The island's natural gas reserves, crucial for about 40% of its electricity generation, are especially precarious with only an 11-day supply on hand, planned to increase to 14 days by 2027. In contrast, coal reserves are more substantial at 42 days, providing a slightly longer buffer in case of supply interruptions",

In 2021, a major outage affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, while another in 2022 impacted 5.5 million households. The operating margin on the grid, which should ideally be 25% in a secure system, has dropped to as low as 5% on several occasions in recent years. These incidents underscore the fragility of Taiwan's power system and its struggle to maintain a stable electricity supply. The American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan has noted that brownouts are commonplace, further emphasizing the precarious state of the island's energy infrastructure",

Renewable energy targets set to replace nuclear power have fallen short, with renewables accounting for only 9.5% of the energy mix in 2023, far below the 20% target for 2025. Addressing the energy crunch requires a multifaceted approach, including enhancing generation capacity through decentralized renewable sources, expanding energy storage facilities, and potentially reconsidering the complete nuclear phase-out. Additionally, land constraints and political considerations complicate efforts to expand renewable energy capacity, while underpriced electricity bills have led to increased demand and supply shortfalls",
